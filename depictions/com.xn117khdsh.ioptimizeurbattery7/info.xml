The only tweak that can double your battery life&#xA;
- Clever: automatically switches off battery-draining components when unused&#xA;
- Efficient: up to 2 times battery life and more!&#xA;
- Wise: extends battery life time by reducing number of charge cycles&#xA;
- Clear: includes monitoring views to check battery state in real-time!&#xA;
- Intuitive: with pull to refresh feature&#xA;
BattSaver app on your home screen&#xA;
One that had problem with icon not showing may has to reboot her/his iPhone to make the icon show.&#xA;
Some people asked where is the battery event database: it is store in /private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/ com.xvolks.iOptimizerUrBattery-stats/stats.db&#xA;
As usual, if the list of applications is empty or not up-to-date, go back and recheck (asynchronous refresh).</description>
